- 🔐 Audit logging without content exposure

## 🧪 Dementia Care Optimization

### Specialized Features for Memory Impairment

```javascript
// Dementia-specific response generation
const dementiaInstructions = `
DEMENTIA CARE GUIDELINES:
- NEVER correct or contradict user memories
- Use validation therapy - affirm feelings
- Respond with warmth and patience
- Redirect gently to positive aspects
- Use simple, clear language
- Avoid overwhelming information
`;
```

### Clinical Best Practices Implemented
- **Validation Therapy**: Never corrects user memories
- **Reminiscence Therapy**: Encourages positive memory exploration
- **Response Timing**: 2-3 second delay to reduce anxiety
- **Simple Language**: Clear, non-technical communication
- **Emotional Support**: Warm, empathetic responses

## 🚀 Integration Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core System Integration (Week 1-2)

#### Immediate Replacements
1. **Chat Experience**: Replace `js/emma-chat-experience.js` keyword matching
2. **Extension Chat**: Upgrade `js/content-universal.js` basic search
3. **Dementia Companion**: Enhance `js/emma-dementia-companion.js` context analysis

#### Integration Points
```javascript
// Example: Enhanced chat experience
class EmmaChatExperience extends ExperiencePopup {
  async generateEmmaResponse(userMessage) {
    // OLD: Hardcoded keyword responses
    // NEW: Vectorless intelligence
    const result = await this.vectorlessEngine.processQuestion(userMessage);
    return result.response;
  }
}
```
