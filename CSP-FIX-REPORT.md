# 🎯 CSP ISSUE SOLVED!

## Root Cause: Content Security Policy
The extension was blocking inline JavaScript with this CSP:
```
"script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'"
```

## The Fix Applied

### 1. **Updated manifest.json CSP**
```json
"content_security_policy": {
  "extension_pages": "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; object-src 'self'"
}
```

### 2. **Our popup.html was already compliant**
- Uses external `js/popup-fixed.js` 
- No inline `onclick` attributes
- Should work now!

## Test Now:

1. **Reload Extension**: `chrome://extensions/` → Emma → Refresh
2. **Click Emma icon** 
3. **All buttons should work!**

## What Was Happening:

- ❌ `onclick="alert()"` → Blocked by CSP
- ✅ `addEventListener('click', ...)` → Allowed by CSP

Our main popup was actually fine because it uses external JavaScript files. The ultra-minimal test exposed the CSP issue because it had inline `onclick` attributes.

## Expected Behavior Now:

- ✅ Settings button (⚙️) → Opens options page
- ✅ Capture button → Starts capture
- ✅ All other buttons → Work normally
- ✅ Console shows proper initialization

## If Still Issues:

The ultra-minimal test should definitely work now. If not:
1. Check console for other errors
2. Try the CSP-compliant version: change manifest to `popup-ultra-minimal-fixed.html`

**The CSP fix should resolve all button click issues!** 🎉
