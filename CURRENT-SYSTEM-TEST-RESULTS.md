# üß™ CURRENT SYSTEM TEST RESULTS
## Pre-Revolution Baseline - What Must Work for Debbe

**Test Date:** Before Architectural Revolution
**Purpose:** Document working functionality to preserve for demo

---

## üîç **CURRENT ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS**

### **Extension-Primary Flow (CURRENT):**
```
1. Extension popup ‚Üí User selects .emma file
2. Extension background ‚Üí Loads vault data into currentVaultData
3. Extension background ‚Üí Holds all data in volatile service worker memory
4. Web app ‚Üí Requests data from extension
5. Extension ‚Üí Returns data from currentVaultData
6. Web app ‚Üí Displays data but doesn't persist it
```

### **CRITICAL FAILURE POINT:**
- **Service worker restart** ‚Üí `currentVaultData = null`
- **Web app requests data** ‚Üí Gets empty array
- **User sees:** "Vault locked" (but it's actually data loss)

### **KEY FUNCTIONS TO PRESERVE:**
- `handleSaveMemoryToVault()` - Memory creation flow
- `startImageCapture()` - Image detection and selection
- `createMemoryCapsuleFromImages()` - Memory capsule creation
- `saveToIndexedDB()` - Web app persistence (enhance this)
- `restoreVaultState()` - Web app recovery (make primary)

## ‚úÖ **CORE FUNCTIONALITY TESTS**

### 1. **Extension Loading**
- [ ] Extension loads without errors
- [ ] Popup opens and shows vault status
- [ ] Content scripts inject properly
- [ ] Background service worker starts

### 2. **Vault Operations**
- [ ] Create new vault works
- [ ] Open existing vault works
- [ ] Passphrase entry works
- [ ] Vault status displays correctly

### 3. **Image Capture (CRITICAL FOR DEBBE)**
- [ ] Image detection on websites
- [ ] Image selection and preview
- [ ] Memory creation with images
- [ ] Saved to vault successfully

### 4. **Memory Management**
- [ ] Memory constellation view loads
- [ ] Individual memory dialogs open
- [ ] Memory editing works
- [ ] People connections display

### 5. **Data Persistence**
- [ ] Page refresh preserves vault state
- [ ] Extension reload preserves data
- [ ] Browser restart preserves data
- [ ] File operations work correctly

## üö® **KNOWN ISSUES TO FIX**

### **Service Worker Data Loss**
- **Symptom:** Vault shows "unlocked" but returns 0 memories
- **Cause:** Service worker restart with failed auto-recovery
- **Impact:** Appears as "auto-lock" to user
- **Fix Status:** Detection added, forces re-unlock

### **Extension-Web App Sync**
- **Symptom:** Extension and web app lose sync
- **Cause:** Volatile service worker memory
- **Impact:** Inconsistent vault status
- **Fix Status:** Multiple sync mechanisms added

---

## üéØ **REVOLUTIONARY SOLUTION TARGET**

**Transform to Web App-Primary:**
- Web app holds all vault data (never loses it)
- Extension becomes pure crypto service
- No more service worker data loss
- Perfect persistence for dementia users

---

## üíú **FOR DEBBE - SUCCESS CRITERIA**

1. **Vault never appears to "lock itself"**
2. **Image capture works on any website**
3. **Memory constellation is beautiful and stable**
4. **Simple, dementia-friendly interface**
5. **Zero technical errors visible to user**

**THESE MUST WORK PERFECTLY TOMORROW** ‚ù§Ô∏è
