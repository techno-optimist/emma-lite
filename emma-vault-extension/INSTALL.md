## 💜 A Personal Note

This extension was built with love for Debbe and all the mothers, fathers, and loved ones whose memories we're honored to help preserve. Every feature was designed to be simple enough for anyone to use, because memories are too precious to be complicated.

If you're setting this up for someone with memory challenges, you might want to:
- Write down the location of their .emma file
- Show them the green checkmark that means "everything is saved"
- Let them know they never have to remember passwords

**Remember**: Your memories, always with you. 💜
